# isLucky
  This is a coding challenge on CodeSignal that I solved. You have to check if the number is lucky, meaning that sum of the first half of digits in the number is equal to the sum of the second half of digits in the number. I solved this challenge by converting the number (given as a parameter) to a string and using two for loops to iterate through the two halves of the string. I created two integers and initially set them to 0. However, I took the sum of the digits (characters which I converted back to an int) and then checked if the two integers I created were equal to each other. This is how I solved the coding challenge isLucky.
